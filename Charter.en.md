**RISC-V China Summit Steering Committee Charter**

*History, committees and rules*

Summary

This document aims to explain the origins, committee structure, rules, and guidelines of the RISC-V China Summit. Since the inaugural China Summit in 2021, the steering committee has accumulated relatively rich experience. This document aims to provide a more coherent and systematic framework for future summits.

# History

The RISC-V China Summit (RVSC) began in 2021, organized and initiated by Guo Xiongfei and Wu Wei, then China liaisons of the RISC-V International Foundation (RVI), with the support of then-CEO of RVI (Calista Redmond). ShanghaiTech University served as the host of the first RISC-V China Summit, and the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, served as a co-host. From 2022 to 2025, the second to fifth RISC-V China Summits were held online and in Beijing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai, respectively.

The initial RVSC Steering Committee (SC) was honorary, with Wu Wei and Guo Xiongfei handling the actual organization. As the influence of the RISC-V China Summit grew, the decision-making process regarding the selection of the city and host city attracted industry attention, necessitating a more professional decision-making process to ensure the neutrality, inclusivity, and universality of the RISC-V China Summit. In 2024, the RVI Board of Directors (BoD) decided to form a new SC with Guo Xiongfei and Wu Wei through voluntary application by BoD members. A total of seven RVI BoD members or designated representatives joined (see Appendix 1 for the list). After the reorganized SC was established, a simple majority vote was used to select the city and host city for the 2025 RISC-V China Summit, but discussions were not held regarding the SC's own membership additions or other bylaws. Between 2024 and 2025, the SC received numerous applications to join; in August 2025, the SC began discussing and formulating its own bylaws.

# Mission and Positioning

The mission of the RISC-V China Summit (RVSC) Steering Committee (SC) is to serve as the guiding and oversight body for the RISC-V China Summit, to coordinate with RVI on the organization and promotion of the RVSC, to ensure the proper use of the "RISC-V" and "RISC-V Summit" brands, and to promote the development of RISC-V in China and globally.

The SC is responsible for developing various processes related to RVSC and overseeing their implementation. The SC votes to determine the host city, organizer, and co-organizer of the RISC-V China Summit each year, appoints key roles such as the Summit Chair, Program Committee Chair, and Organizing Committee Chair, and oversees the entire organization of the RISC-V China Summit to ensure the summit's financial balance, transparency, and global fairness in sponsorship opportunities.

If there are multiple candidates in a competitive election, a two-round majority voting process is used: In the first round, if no candidate receives more than half the votes, the top two candidates are selected by simple majority (the one with the most votes) to advance to the second round; in the second round, one SCC is elected by two candidates with a competitive election, and the candidate with the most votes is elected.
15. Two committee members can jointly initiate a recall vote against an SCC. The joint signatories can organize an extraordinary SC meeting and initiate a vote to remove the SCC.
