# Voting Record for the Establishment of the RISC-V China Summit Steering Committee Charter

Record Date: February 23, 2026

Starting in 2025, the RISC-V China Summit (RVSC) Steering Committee (SC) began drafting and formulating a formal charter document. After more than half a year of discussion and revision, the SC officially began a full vote on February 16, 2026. According to Article 23 of the draft charter, the establishment and amendment of the charter require a two-thirds majority vote of all members to take effect. On February 22, 2026, 7 out of 9 committee members voted in favor [1], the charter was adopted, and published on GitHub [2]. The initial list of SC members was published as an appendix at the end of the charter.

[1] One committee member accidentally selected "abstain" in the OpaVote voting system. Since the voting system could not be reset or modified, the committee member corrected his vote from "abstain" to "approve" via email.
